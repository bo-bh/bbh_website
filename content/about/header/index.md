<!-- this is a subheadline -->

I bring a philosophical and qualitative lens to socio-technical areas like ML evaluation, auditing, risk assessment, red teaming, and vulnerability management. I am an officer at [ARVA](https://avidml.org), the nonprofit home of the AI Vulnerability Database (AVID), an affiliate at [Data & Society](https://datasociety.net/), and a senior consultant at [BABL AI](https://babl.ai). I'm also grateful to be a recipient of the 2023-2024 Magic Grant from [The Brown Institute for Media Innovation](https://brown.columbia.edu/project-type/magic-grants/).
