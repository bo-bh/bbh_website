  Drawing on my background in philosophy, I take a cross-disciplinary and historically informed view of the present, past and future of ethics, rights, and values, and how they interact with socio-technical systems.
  
  Algorithmic accountability is complex, and disorienting. I founded [Accountability Case Labs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wi-OsM4l2HCn-F0L_PomqkpncT5y9DCQF6db2eMwsCY/edit?usp=sharing) to tackle silos in the algorithmic accountability space through participatory workshops and research.
  
  I’m also actively contributing to the ML research community’s recent work on research ethics and ethics review. My recent paper, co-authored with Leif Hancox-Li, examines overlooked structural similarities between IQ and ML benchmarks. This enables us to unlock lessons from feminist philosophy of science scholarship that need to be considered by the ML benchmark community.
  
  I believe that people with PhDs can have a transformative impact outside of academia. During the pandemic, this led me to collaborate on open workshops, grants, networking events, and open resources aimed at the Post Academic community. I’m currently co-director of [Open Post Academics](https://openpostac.org).
  
  I was thrilled to co-design and co-curate Mozilla Festival’s 2022 [Rethinking Power and Ethics Space](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/proposals/space-narratives/#rethinking-power-ethics). 
  
  I hold a PhD in Philosophy from Columbia University. 
  
  In my spare time, I make musical instruments misbehave.
  
  My native language is French. I’m Québecois and Tunisian. I’m currently based in New York City.
