Panel discussion with researchers who worked on The Extended Mind's VR and AR Privacy research as well as folks in industry who use this research.

Panelists are Jessica Outlaw, Sara Carbonneau, Jillian Powers and Beth Duckles. 

Moderated by Borhane Blili-Hamelin

This is the first event in a new series we're calling "Research outside the academy." Events in this series will feature thought provoking examples of impactful research outside of traditional academic settings.

Members of the team behind the Extended Mind's AR/VR Privacy survey (Jessica, Sara, and Beth) will talk about how the research was conceived, planned and executed as well as how it was pitched to make an impact on industry. Our outside expert, Jillian Powers (Cognizant) will talk about giving uptake to this research from within industry.
