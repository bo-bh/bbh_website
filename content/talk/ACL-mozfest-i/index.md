title: Insights from the Accountability Case Labs Project
---

Co-facilitated with Mrin Bhattacharya, and Jillian Powers.

Who are the agents of algorithmic accountability? (Who should hold whom accountable?) What is algorithmic accountability? What are the hard problems around algorithmic accountability? How can you build workshops that address the needs of your own communities on these topics?

We designed an experience that invites participants to collaborate on insights on these questions through activities that draw on Accountability Case Labsâ€™ qualitative research data!
