## Episode description

We are pleased to announce that we have partnered with the Mozilla Foundation, to bring together an incredible podcast series on AI. This is our third episode of the Mozilla Festival series and in this episode, we will be discussing rethinking power and ethics with two Wranglers at this Space at MozFest 2022.

In this episode we speak to Borhane Blili-Hamelin an academic researcher and Umut Pajaro Velasquez a Black Latinx Caribbean queer researcher on how we can expand, shift, and rethink power and how we engage with the intersection of power, and harms, values, rights and democracy in tech.

Despite a general agreement that AI should be ethical, we cannot always say it is. AI, algorithms, big data, and tech often evoke technological utopias, but the lived experiences of people affected by these technologies indicate that they can cause harm, inequity, and injustice. Technology is used in every part of our lives and so how does this impact things such as incarceration and surveillance? The environment? Job security? And what are the hidden and unaccountable ways in which they discriminate and disempower people?
