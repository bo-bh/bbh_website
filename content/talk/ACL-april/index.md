title: Winter 2022 Survey Insights

Co-hosted by Tina Lassiter, Jillian Powers, Beth Duckles, and myself.

Over the months of February and March 2022, we surveyed over 70 experts to build baseline insights into how folks in different roles think about algorithmic accountability. 

This research is exploratory, and meant to inform the questions we investigate next. That’s why we decided to build a collaborative discussion around our data as our first knowledge sharing step! We can’t wait to explore our data with you all!
