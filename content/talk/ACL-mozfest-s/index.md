Co-facilitated with Tina Lassiter and Gina Helfrich. Shout out to Ranjit Singh for helping us build this workshop with his insights and scholarship on the topic.

What is the role of the courts in algorithmic accountability? Who has a role to play in taking algorithms to court? How can the courts protect the public interest around algorithmic procurement? 

This workshop invited participants to think through the case study of a 2021 Frye Motion in Illinois asking the courts to scrutinize the reliability of Shotspotter evidence. 

We used [Timelines, an activity designed by Richmond Y. Wong and Tonya Nguyen](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445447), to invite participants to explore these questions through the level playing field of a world building activity. 

We concluded by inviting participants to reflect on shared insights.
