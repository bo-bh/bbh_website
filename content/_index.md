description: I’m a researcher, consultant, and community builder focused on AI ethics. I help organizations mitigate harm through AI risk management, auditing, and vulnerability management. I build cross-disciplinary research projects on the risks and values embedded in AI systems. I love participatory problem-solving and community-driven projects. My focus is making AI governance more cross-disciplinary, reflective, and empowering for impacted communities.
