description: Iâ€™m a researcher, consultant, and community builder focused on AI ethics. I help organizations mitigate harm through AI risk management, auditing, and vulnerability management. I build socio-technical research projects on the ecosystem of discovery, disclosure, and mitigation of harmful flaws in AI systems. I strive for a world in which the resources that inform the daily work of AI builders are co-created by the many communities working to make AI less harmful.
