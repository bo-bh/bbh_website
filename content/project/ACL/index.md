In 2021, I founded [Accountability Case Labs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wi-OsM4l2HCn-F0L_PomqkpncT5y9DCQF6db2eMwsCY/edit?usp=sharing) to tackle silos in the algorithmic accountability space through participatory workshops and research. 

Accountability Case Labs is an open community dedicated to connecting and building shared insights among algorithmic accountability practitioners. 

During our seeding phase (Fall 2021 to Summer 2022 â€” as part of the first cohort of the MozFest Civil Society Actors for Trustworthy AI), our goals were to co-create our community norms & collaborative practices, to iterate on our MVP of case study based participatory workshops, and to conduct exploratory research that helps identify our next steps. 

To do so, we conducted
* 9 public facing participatory events (4 participatory meetups & 5 workshops, including 2 at MozFest 2022 and 1 at RightsCon 2022)
* A community driven agenda setting process (including identifying, researching case studies, and writing conference applications)
* 5 rounds of community driven workshop design
* Exploratory research (qualitative interviews (Dec 2021-Jan 2022); survey research (Feb 2022-March 2022))
